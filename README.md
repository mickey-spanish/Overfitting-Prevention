# Overfitting-Prevention
Various Regularization Techniques to Prevent Overfitting

Purpose: The purpose is to build and train multilayer fully connected dense layer neural network with different techniques to prevent overfitting. 

In this project, you will use given data sets, but you will experiment with techniques to prevent overfitting. 
In this project we design two models. Model 1 is a fully connected neural network with one dense layer with relu activation and a 10 neuron output layer with softmax activation. Model 2 is a fully connected neural with three hidden layers with relu activation and a 10 neuron output layer with softmax activation.
A.	Model 1 Baseline, Dropout, L1, L2, L1+L2, Batch Normalization
B.	Model 2 Baseline, Dropout, L1, L2, L1+L2, Batch Normalization
 
Plot the training/validation loss and accuracy vs epochs, and discuss the results.
